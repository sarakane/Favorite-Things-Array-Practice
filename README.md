#### _JavaScript arrays exercise for Epicodus_, 06.08.2020_

#### By _**Sara Kane & Ian Scott**_

## Description
Build a page with a form containing input fields where users may enter several of their favorite things.  
Then, write code that gathers each of these form input values and places them into one array.  
After this is done, use your site to practice targeting and moving elements between arrays:  
  * Use square bracket notation to access the second, first, and third elements of the original array of favorite things.  
  * Then, use push() to add only these elements to a brand new array.  
  * Finally, display this new array in your page's HTML as list items in a <ul> tag.
